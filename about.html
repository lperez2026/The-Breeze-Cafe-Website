            <p>The Breeze Cafe Website is a site where people can order things from a regular cafe. Anyone can stay in the website and pretend it's real. It provides all kinds of food ranging from cold milkshakes to delicious sandwiches. Though this website had a little trouble on its development. It took many weeks for it to find the right amount, but soon enough the creator just gave up and did whatever can do. He's this guy below.</p>

            <h3><b>The Creator</b></h3>
            <p>This is the guy who started it all. He's quite smart, but has quite a few flaws. Personally, he wants to improve by a lot, but he doesn't know how. The main reason of why he made this website aside from the fact that it's an assignment, is that he wanted to sharpen his skills on the subject. Sadly, this aged like milk. It didn't work and instead made his situation a lot more worst and practically motivated him to hate working again. No matter, he did it all under a single night and thanked his family and friends for the moral support (If it was actually real haha).</p>
            <h3><b>Editor's Note:</b></h3>
            <p>Hey, it's me. First of all, it's literally 1am around the time of production and I just wanted to say that, not all people are perfect. I don't know what else to say other than that because why not? Additionally, I miss C++. It made more sense than HTML than my whole career in CS. Yeah, that's about it. If you want, you can follow me on Twitter or Facebook. I won't give you my profile that easily since I'm being mysterious. Although, if you actally do find my account, you'd be disappointed because it'll be inactive most of the time. Well, that's life, deal with it. Alright, I'm out, see you.</p>
